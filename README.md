# Risk-based-cyber-monitoring
Risk-driven cybersecurity monitoring model integrating GRC, EDR/XDR concepts, and OT considerations.
Risk-Based Cybersecurity Monitoring Model (IT & OT)
Executive Summary

This project presents a risk-driven approach to cybersecurity monitoring, integrating Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) principles with technical detection capabilities such as EDR/XDR.

Rather than focusing on tools or alert volume, the model prioritizes business-critical, safety-critical, and regulated assets, ensuring that monitoring supports risk reduction, accountability, and informed decision-making.

The model is designed to be applicable to enterprise IT environments as well as Operational Technology (OT) / Industrial Control Systems (ICS), where availability and safety constraints require explicit governance decisions.

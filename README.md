# Risk-Based Cybersecurity Monitoring

![Risk-Based Monitoring Flow](risk_based_monitoring_flow.png)

Risk-driven cybersecurity monitoring model integrating Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) principles with technical detection capabilities such as EDR/XDR, with considerations for both IT and OT environments.

---

## Executive Summary

This project presents a structured, risk-based approach to cybersecurity monitoring. Instead of treating monitoring as a purely technical function, the model aligns detection capabilities with business risk, regulatory exposure, and executive oversight.

The repository demonstrates how governance-driven risk identification informs monitoring strategy, how detection results are escalated and owned, and how leadership metrics are derived to support informed decision-making. The approach is applicable to generic enterprise environments and can be extended to regulated sectors such as energy, manufacturing, and healthcare.

## Framework Alignment

This project is conceptually aligned with the following industry standards and frameworks:

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Detect, Respond)
- ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002
- IEC 62443 (for OT/ICS considerations)
- Risk-based monitoring and continuous assurance principles

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:

- Cybersecurity professionals pursuing Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) roles  
- SOC analysts and detection engineers seeking risk-aligned monitoring context  
- Security leaders and managers responsible for oversight and reporting  
- Professionals working in or transitioning to regulated and critical infrastructure environments  

---

## Scope and Limitations

This project focuses on **conceptual design and governance structure**, not tool-specific implementation. It does not include vendor configurations, scripts, or live telemetry. The goal is to demonstrate **thinking, structure, and decision logic**, rather than operational deployment.

---

## Future Enhancements

Planned extensions include:

- Industry-specific risk scenarios (energy, manufacturing, healthcare)  
- Expanded EDR/XDR coverage models  
- Visual dashboards for executive metrics  
- Additional OT-focused monitoring examples

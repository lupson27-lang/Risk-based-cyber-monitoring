| Asset / System | Risk Description | Business / Safety Impact | Threat Scenario | Monitoring Objective | Residual Risk / Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Domain Controllers / Identity Services | Unauthorized privilege escalation or lateral movement | High: Compromise could affect all enterprise systems | Insider or external attacker obtains admin credentials and moves laterally | Detect unusual login patterns, multiple failed logins, privilege changes | Residual risk exists for offline or legacy admin accounts; periodic review required |
| Customer Data / Database Servers | Data exfiltration or corruption | High: Legal/regulatory and reputational impact | SQL injection, unauthorized access, insider misuse | Monitor data access patterns, unusual queries, and database errors | Some shadow or third-party systems may not be fully visible; compensating controls in place |
| Email / Collaboration Tools | Phishing or malware delivery | Medium-High: Could lead to credential theft or malware outbreak | External phishing campaigns, malicious attachments | Detect mass email anomalies, attachment sandboxing alerts | Some external systems may bypass monitoring; user awareness campaigns recommended |
| Critical Application Servers | Service disruption or compromise | Medium-High: Could affect customer-facing applications | Exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities or misconfigurations | Monitor application logs, error patterns, and unusual behavior | Monitoring may not cover cloud-managed services fully; periodic audit required |
| Network Infrastructure | Unauthorized access or lateral movement | High: Could lead to network-wide compromise | Rogue devices, misconfigured firewall, compromised endpoints | Monitor unusual traffic patterns, device changes, firewall logs | Some network segments may have limited monitoring due to legacy hardware |

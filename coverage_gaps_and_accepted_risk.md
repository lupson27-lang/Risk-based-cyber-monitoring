| Asset / System                  | Monitoring Gap                                    | Reason / Constraint                                                                  | Accepted Risk / Mitigation                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Legacy Domain Controllers       | Unable to install endpoint agent on older servers | Technical limitation; agent incompatible with OS version                             | Residual risk accepted; periodic offline audits and manual log reviews                                   |
| OT / Industrial Control Systems | Limited telemetry from PLCs and SCADA devices     | Operational safety and uptime constraints; agents may interfere with process control | Residual risk documented; mitigated by periodic process monitoring, physical security, and safety alarms |
| Shadow IT / SaaS Applications   | Some cloud applications are unmanaged or unknown  | Lack of visibility; unauthorized SaaS adoption by business units                     | Residual risk accepted; quarterly discovery audits and user awareness programs                           |
| Third-Party Managed Systems     | Limited monitoring of vendor-hosted services      | External service management; no agent or log access                                  | Residual risk accepted; contractual SLAs and periodic vendor audits                                      |
| Remote / Mobile Endpoints       | Intermittent connectivity or offline devices      | Endpoint may not always send telemetry                                               | Residual risk accepted; critical systems use VPN check-ins, conditional access policies                  |
